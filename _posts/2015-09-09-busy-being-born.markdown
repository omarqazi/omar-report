If you design software you have to check out [the photos Bill Atkinson took as he built the user interface for the Macintosh](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Busy_Being_Born.txt). They played around with the whole thing for about five years before the initial release. Watching the creation of an interface paradigm that's now so thoroughly entrenched in computing is actually kind of funny in a weird way.

The story mentions that Bill Atkinson loved photography, which reminded me of when I met Bill briefly about 5 years ago. It was 2010, the day the original iPad came out, and I was waiting in line at the Palo Alto Apple store. Bill Atkinson was actually walking around the line with an iPad and a bunch of postcards showing off an app he built called PhotoCard. The app let you build a postcard and actually have it printed and sent out via snail mail. I think I actually used it a few times and it worked great, but it wasn't exactly a billion dollar app and looked like a totally average app built by an average guy. It was actually kind of ugly. Most people in the line seemed to think he was just some random guy promoting his app, and probably didn't realize what a superstar Bill is. I had just come to the Valley, and there was Bill Atkinson standing in front of me; pitching me his iPad app to me one on one. This was one of the moments that made me decide I had to move up to the Bay Area as soon as I could, and to this day one of the weirdest things I've ever seen at an Apple store. Steve Jobs visited the Palo Alto store that day too.
