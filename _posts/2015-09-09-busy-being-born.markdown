If you design software you have to check out [the photos Bill Atkinson took as he built the user interface for the Macintosh](http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=Busy_Being_Born.txt). He played around with the whole thing for about five years before the initial release. Watching the creation of an interface paradigm that's now so thoroughly entrenched in computing is actually kind of funny in a weird way.
